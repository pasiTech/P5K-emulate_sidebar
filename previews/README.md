## DefaultBehavior
Shows typical Plasma 5 behavior when it comes to manipulating windows. Notice
how the plasmoid sidebar is covered by opening, tiling, and maximizing.

## SidebarBehavior
The same desktop with Emulate Sidebars KWin script activated. Notice how
windows do not interfere with the sidebar in normal circumstances.

## SmartDetection
Shows how a top or bottom panel will create virtual sidebars. Notice how the panel is ignored as long as it is full width or centered. But if you shrink 
it and go to the left or right the window maximization respects the virtual
sidebar.

## DifferentSidebars
A sample use case of two different activities with sidebars on different sides.
On the system desktop, notice how the Konsole window can be placed in the
virtual sidebar and not be covered up.
